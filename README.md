Introduction
The Monster Slayer Game is a simple turn-based game where the player battles against a monster. Each player takes turns attacking until one of them is defeated. This project was developed as part of a Vue.js learning course to solidify understanding of key Vue.js concepts.

Features
Player vs Monster: A basic turn-based combat system.
Health Bars: Displays the health of both the player and the monster.
Attack Options: Includes regular attacks, special attacks, healing, and surrender.
Battle Log: A log that tracks each action taken during the game.
Responsive UI: The game adjusts to different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
Vue.js: The progressive JavaScript framework used for building the user interface.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the application.
JavaScript (ES6): Core scripting language for game logic.
Bootstrap: For basic styling and layout.
Getting Started
To run the game locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/GovindaTak/Vue_project-The-Monster-Slayer-Game.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd monster-slayer-game
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run serve
Open the game in your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to start playing.

How to Play
Attack: Perform a basic attack on the monster.

Data Binding: Binding dynamic data to the DOM.
Event Handling: Handling user interactions such as clicks.
Conditional Rendering: Displaying elements conditionally based on the application state.
Component-Based Architecture: Structuring the application using reusable components.
Computed Properties and Methods: Implementing reactive properties and functions.
Future Enhancements
